# Soccer-Stuf
For this project, we will look at building a model to predict the outcome of soccer  matches.

The initial file will contain basic approach to building a  betting model. We will look at 
using the poisson distribution to build the model. This has been widely used in many literatures.
We will also potentially explore the Bayesian approach to building the model. Given this is a
 basic model, we will only use goals as the main indicator to predict outcome of matches. In 
future work, we will include the market  value of  players, injury situations, lineups, 
uncertainty around the club(press)  and a host of other interesting variables.

Remember to install all the needed packages prior to running the file..
